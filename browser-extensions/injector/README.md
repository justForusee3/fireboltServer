Injector
========

# Overview

Injector is a Chrome extension that lets you conveniently inject the "activateMockFirebolt.js" script on a page before it loads. This lets you activate Mock Firebolt for an app, even if/when that app has been written and/or deployed without this script.

It requires that you also run [Mock Firebolt](https://github.com/rdkcentral/mock-firebolt) on your machine.


## Ongoing use

While this plugin is enabled, it will inject the activateMockFirebolt.js script into any page where the URL includes "?mf=" or "&mf=". You must disable this plugin if/when you do not want this functionality.
