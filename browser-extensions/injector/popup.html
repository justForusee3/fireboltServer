    While you have the injector browser extension activated, any time you visit
    a page with "?mf=" or "&mf=" in the URL, the
    <strong>activateMockFirebolt.js</strong>
    script will be injected on the page. This will tell the Firebolt SDK in your app
    to talk to Mock Firebolt. See https://github.com/rdkcentral/mock-firebolt for more
    information.
